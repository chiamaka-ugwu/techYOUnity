              not exactly know or have an idea what I was going into, the first
              day I opened Figma it was like a whole new different world, being
              someone that would always excel in anything I do, someone who
              conquered every hurdle it was TECH was too much a meat for me to
              bite. I cried, cried, and cried again, it was the most
              overwhelming phase of my Life, emotionally, physically,
              spiritually, financially, and otherwise. Nothing prepares us for
              the amount of data, time, resources, the knowledge we invest in
              this journey. Should we talk about the eye defects, as result of
              the screen time, the back aches, etc, and let's not get started on
              the pressure, the social media noise from tech influencers.”
